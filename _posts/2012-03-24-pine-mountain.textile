Jess and I took to the hills for the second weekend in a row, this time near her home in southwestern Connecticut. Pine Mountain was an easy hike, but the peak was a little tricky to find because the trail did not lead directly to it.

The WPX SSB contest was going on this weekend, so the bands were jam-packed. Despite this, the SOTA chasers were resilient and came through to give me enough contacts for a successful activation. Thanks, guys!

This was the first portable deployment of the Dummipole dipole system featured in the video. It is fully configurable to any band---just cut the wire to length! No balun here. It functioned brilliantly on 15m tied to some trees at breast-height, and scored me a contact in Scotland.

I've always wanted to try a wire antenna suspended by a kite. Conditions were ripe on this blustery spring afternoon to take the kite out for a fly on Quabbin Hill, site of my most recent SOTA activation.

It's all in the video, but this was what I consider a rousing success. Here's what I would have done differently:

* Get a bigger kite with more lift and possibly a higher flying angle
* Use smaller-gauge stranded wire, which is lighter and easier for the kite to lift
* Pick a day with steadier (less gusty) wind

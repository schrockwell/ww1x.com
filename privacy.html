    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    
    <p>
        Here's the deal: you probably don't want me to collect any information about you. Well, that's
        perfect, because I don't want it. The iOS applications <b>WaveGuide</b> and <b>SOTA Goat</b>
        only store enough information to keep their primary functionality working, and not much more.
    </p>


    <h4>The following information may be stored:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Your name and callsign (if you have logged into SOTAwatch3)</li>
        <li>Push notification preferences (if configured)</li>
        <li>A timestamp when the app was most recently launched</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The following information will NEVER be stored:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Your e-mail address</li>
        <li>Third-party account passwords</li>
    </ul>

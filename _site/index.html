<ul>
	<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A long, hot hike, and a so-so 20m band, but all the more rewarding</li>
	<li><strong>DX:</strong> Scotland, Wales, France, Czech Republic</li>
	<li><strong>U.S.:</strong> MA, AR, OR, NC, NY</li>
</ul>
<p>This hike was a little more than we had bargained for. We got a late start and had to fight the sun and heat for this 2.5 mile hike out the summit that ran along the edge of the ridge, not offering much in the way of shade or places to take a break. However, the view of the valley was breathtaking.</p>
<p>After 10 QSOs in just 25 minutes, we hoofed it back to the car just in time to make it out of the park before they locked up the gates for the night.</p>
<p>The homebrew Buddipole performed well on 20m, as usual, and I ran 25 watts into it this time. I was lucky that I did not experience too much interference from the myriad of broadcast antennas atop the summit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to try a wire antenna suspended by a kite. Conditions were ripe on this blustery spring afternoon to take the kite out for a fly on Quabbin Hill, site of my most recent <span class="caps">SOTA</span> activation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the video, but this was what I consider a rousing success. Here&#8217;s what I would have done differently:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get a bigger kite with more lift and possibly a higher flying angle</li>
	<li>Use smaller-gauge stranded wire, which is lighter and easier for the kite to lift</li>
	<li>Pick a day with steadier (less gusty) wind</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A windy day in which 20m opened into Eastern Europe</li>
	<li><strong>DX:</strong> Spain, England, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia</li>
	<li><strong>U.S.:</strong> MA, AR, OR, NC</li>
</ul>
<p>No video today!</p>
<p>This activation was a spur-of-the-moment idea. With rain impeding on our weekend plans, Jess and I decided to take a quick jaunt up Quabbin Hill on this Friday afternoon. The hill is a great recreational area that overlooks the Quabbin Reservoir.</p>
<p>I worked 20m for an hour, racking up QSOs with the usual <span class="caps">SOTA</span> chasers. I even made contact with N4EX, who was very nearly buried in the noise. I was able to pull out his callsign and complete the <span class="caps">QSO</span>, but man, it took a while. I could barely even hear him, and the wind didn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>Around 20:00 <span class="caps">UTC</span>, the band appeared to suddenly open up into eastern Europe. I heard many Italy stations, and one even responded to my CQ! I was still running just 5 watts at this point! I then knocked out QSOs into Slovenia, and at 25 watts I was able to reach Croatia.</p>
<p>This is what I really love about amateur radio: I can talk down the street in one breath, then talk across the world in the next. The unpredictability keeps me coming back for more, because you never know the next station who will come back to your CQ.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Had good results on 20m and 17m today, including a summit-to-summit with Germany, and a station in Oman</li>
	<li><strong>DX:</strong> Germany, Oman</li>
	<li><strong>U.S.:</strong> MA, AR, WI, AL</li>
</ul>
<p>Ross and Jess joined me for this weekend&#8217;s <span class="caps">SOTA</span> expedition in the Holyoke Range. This was the first portable deployment of my homemade Buddipole antenna system, and it was quite effective.</p>
<p>I got to talk to many members of the <span class="caps">SOTA</span> Jerks for the first time, which was great. I started on 20m and shifted up to 17m to get away from the main bands a little bit. This opened up the door for a few more QSOs, including a summit-to-summit with German station <a href="http://qrz.com/db/dl3sba">DL3SBA</a> on the peak <a href="http://www.sotawatch.org/summits.php?summit=DM/NW-135">DM/NW-135</a>. I had tried to work him on 20m earlier with no success, so I&#8217;m glad he was able to find me when I switched bands.</p>
<p>Another big contact, albeit on 100W, was with <a href="http://qrz.com/db/a41mx">A41MX</a> in Oman. I was tuned to an open frequency on 17m, chatting with another ham who happened to be hiking, when this signal popped up out of nowhere. I&#8217;m glad I snagged him before the pileup began.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Summary:</strong> <span class="caps">SSB</span> contest made QSOs tough, but squeezed out 4 QSOs for an activation point</li>
	<li><strong>DX:</strong> Canada, Scotland</li>
	<li><strong>U.S.:</strong> AR, ID</li>
</ul>
<p>Jess and I took to the hills for the second weekend in a row, this time near her home in southwestern Connecticut. Pine Mountain was an easy hike, but the peak was a little tricky to find because the trail did not lead directly to it.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">WPX</span> <span class="caps">SSB</span> contest was going on this weekend, so the bands were jam-packed. Despite this, the <span class="caps">SOTA</span> chasers were resilient and came through to give me enough contacts for a successful activation. Thanks, guys!</p>
<p>This was the first portable deployment of the Dummipole dipole system featured in the video. It is fully configurable to any band&#8212;-just cut the wire to length! No balun here. It functioned brilliantly on 15m tied to some trees at breast-height, and scored me a contact in Scotland.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">SOTA</span> Madness</h3>
<p>One video was all it took.</p>
<p>You can thank my obsession with Summits On The Air on one <a href="http://www.qrz.com/db/WG0AT">Steve Galchutt, WG0AT</a>, also known as &#8220;the goat man&#8221;. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/goathiker/">His YouTube channel</a> is populated with dozens of videos of himself and his pack goats, Rooster and Peanut, pounding trails all over the west, working the world on <span class="caps">SSB</span> and CW with just a simple, portable setup.</p>
<p>For some reason, this appealed to me. To me, this is very much in the spirit of amateur radio: pushing the limits of weight, power, and portability to new extremes, and spawning innovation.</p>
<p>Plus, cute mountain goats.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sota.org.uk/">Summits On The Air</a> (<span class="caps">SOTA</span>) is a program that formalizes this endeavor, providing a framework for hikers (known as &#8220;activators&#8221;) and those who spot them (the &#8220;chasers&#8221;) to gain points and compete with one another. It&#8217;s all in good fun, and the community appears to be very tightly-knit. Every day is an opportunity for a new activation and a new station to chase.</p>
<p>Sales of <a href="/waveguide/">WaveGuide</a> enabled me to purchase my second HF radio, the <a href="http://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;ProdCatID=102&amp;encProdID=8CBB7C4BDBAF40129AD4253A4987523C">Yaesu FT-857D</a>. Designed for mobile installations in cars, the 857 is very compact and feature-rich, and it even includes <span class="caps">VHF</span> and <span class="caps">UHF</span> bands. It&#8217;s a perfect rig for hiking and portable operations.</p>
<h3>Activation Time!</h3>
<p>The unseasonably-warm weather this March led to my first <span class="caps">SOTA</span> activation this weekend. My girlfriend, Jess, was kind enough to join me, helping to carry some of the gear. We chose Bare Mountain, in the Holyoke range, because we knew the parking area would be open, and it s a relatively short, albeit steep, hike. After summiting around noon and spending 45 minutes getting the stupid 20m dipole tangled in trees, I was ready to get on the air. There was only one problem.</p>
<p>The microphone was back at the apartment.</p>
<p>I had been messing around with digital modes the night before and testing some microphone connections to the PC, and had forgotten to reconnect the mic when I was done. So, it was back down the trail I went. It only took about an hour to hike down, drive home, retrieve, the mic, then drive back and hoof it back to the top.</p>
<p>By 2:30 PM <span class="caps">EDT</span> (1830 <span class="caps">UTC</span>), I was set to go. Over the next hour, the QSOs came in waves, with many <span class="caps">SOTA</span> spotters reporting in. Signal reports varied from a barely-copyable 44 to booming 59&#8217;s. The band was very fickle, with lots of signal fading occurring over the course of a conversation. I even encountered some intentional <span class="caps">QRM</span> in another language (slurred), but I just ignored it and moved to another frequency. It was annoying, but nothing to lose my cool over.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>My very first <span class="caps">SOTA</span> activation resulted in 13 QSOs on the 20 meter band, all of them <span class="caps">SSB</span> mode on just 5W of transmit power. This included DX stations in five other European countries, and five U.S. states.</p>
<p>2 meter simplex on 146.52 was surprisingly quiet, and I didn&#8217;t make any contacts on <span class="caps">VHF</span>. I guess everybody was outside enjoying the weather.</p>
<p>I am extremely happy with how everything went. As far as radio conditions go, I could not have asked for more. I met some really great people on the air and made some cool connections within the <span class="caps">SOTA</span> community as a result of the above video, which I think came out really well. I already have another activation planned for next weekend, and I can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Thank you to WG0AT for the fun videos and the inspiration to get involved in <span class="caps">SOTA</span>. Thank you to all the <span class="caps">SOTA</span> chasers who gave me awesome QSOs this weekend.</p>
<p>And thank you, Jess, for still dating me after this whole ordeal. I still think you&#8217;re cuter than Rooster and Peanut.</p>

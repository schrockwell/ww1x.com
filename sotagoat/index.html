			<h4 style="line-height: 1.5em">SOTA Goat is an all-in-one utility for Summits On The Air activators and chasers.</h4>

			<p>It was designed from the ground up as an invaluable tool for summit activators &ndash; <strong>it's as necessary as your transceiver and power supply!</strong></p>
			
			<p>The database of over 55,000 summits is instantly available at your fingertips &ndash; <strong>no Internet connection necessary.</strong> Search by summit name, location, or use the handy map if you want to browse summits in a particular area. Summits can be marked as Favorites, providing a shortcut for future reference.</p>
			
			<p>Mountain Goats and Shack Sloths alike will also appreciate the ability to <strong>view and share summit activations and signal reports from <a href="http://sotawatch.org/">SOTAwatch</a></strong>. Spot your friends, spot yourself, and do whatever you can to get more points!</p>
			
			<p>You can also register for Push Notifications <span class="new"></span> to be alerted of ongoing summit activations, even when your phone is off or you are using another app.</p>

			<p>SOTA Goat is a <strong>Universal app</strong> that is available for all devices that support iOS 6, including iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.</p>
